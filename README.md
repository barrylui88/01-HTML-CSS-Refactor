# HTML CSS Refactor for Horiseon

## Description 

This webpage outlines the contents for describing the services of Horiseon - a professional web services company.

This webpage exists as starter code for my first module challenge and intentionally contained a number of defects and poor practices including broken links, unnecessary CSS code and non-semantic HTML. This was a great opportunity for me to apply the knowledge learned over the course of week 1 to refactor both the HTML and CSS files to follow best practices.

Following this task, I've certainly enhanced my skills to both read and understand code as well as being able to identify inconsistencies and appreciate the importance of semantic HTML for the purpose of full accessibility.
